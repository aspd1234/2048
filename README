Short Response:

1) To find and replace every instance of the word "fun" with "amazing", do
:%s/fun/amazing/g
To find and replace only the first instance of the words, do
:s/fun/amazing/g

2) To make a directory inside a dirctory, do
mkdir -p fooDir/barDir

3) If you type cd* in command mode, it will search for anything that starts
with cd.

4) To open all files in a given director, do
gvim*

5) A static method is one that does not need a caller variable to use the
method with. For example, if you wanted to use the static method abs(int),
then you can just do Math.abs(int number).

6) The student should make classes for different shapes that can be 
subclasses of ShapeDrawer, and they can all have their own specific 
parameters for the methods.
